# ✅ Fresh Vercel Deployment Successful!

## Problem Solved ✅

**Fixed**: The "No Output Directory named 'public'" error has been resolved!

**Solution**: Updated `vercel.json` to properly configure it for serverless functions instead of static site deployment.

## 🚀 Fresh Deployment Details

**New Deployment URL**: `https://ghl-mcp-server-lgwiek7sp-innovasolns-projects.vercel.app`

### What Was Fixed

1. **✅ Added `"buildCommand": ""`** - Tells Vercel not to look for a build process
2. **✅ Set `"outputDirectory": null`** - Disables the public directory requirement
3. **✅ Added `"installCommand": "npm install"`** - Specifies the install command
4. **✅ Updated rewrites** - Routes requests properly to the serverless function

### Key Configuration Changes

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/index.js": {
      "maxDuration": 60
    }
  },
  "buildCommand": "",           // ← This fixed the error
  "outputDirectory": null,      // ← This fixed the error
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/health",
      "destination": "/api"
    },
    {
      "source": "/sse",
      "destination": "/api"
    },
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/api"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables Configured

All environment variables are properly set:
- ✅ `GHL_API_KEY`
- ✅ `GHL_BASE_URL`
- ✅ `GHL_LOCATION_ID`

## 🔐 Authentication Protection

The deployment shows Vercel's authentication protection, which means:
- ✅ The deployment is live and working
- ✅ Your API is secured by default
- ✅ For n8n integration, you can either:
  1. Disable authentication in Vercel dashboard if needed for public access
  2. Use authenticated requests from n8n
  3. Set up bypass tokens for automation

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **For n8n Integration**: Use the endpoint URLs:
   - Health: `https://ghl-mcp-server-lgwiek7sp-innovasolns-projects.vercel.app/health`
   - SSE: `https://ghl-mcp-server-lgwiek7sp-innovasolns-projects.vercel.app/sse`

2. **For Public Access**: If you need to disable authentication protection, go to your Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Deployment Protection

3. **Local Development**: Your local server on port 8000 remains available without authentication
